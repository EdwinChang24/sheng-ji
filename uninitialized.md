# Android App Template (Uninitialized)

It looks like you've created a new repository from the template, but automatic initialization couldn't be completed.
This may be due to not filling in the repository description with the correct format.

To finish initialization of the repository, go to the `Actions` tab in GitHub and click on the
`Finish project initialization` action in the left sidebar. You should see an indicator that the workflow has a
`workflow_dispatch` event trigger. Click `Run workflow` and fill in the required fields, then start the workflow.
The GitHub Actions workflow will finish setting up your project.

Happy coding!

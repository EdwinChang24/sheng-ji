# Android App Template

This is a template for building an Android app. Please read the instructions before using.

## Usage

Use the button at the top right to create a new repository from this template.
Then, enter in your desired repository name.

For the description, use the following format:

```
app:com.example.myapplication My Application
```

The description should start with `app:`, followed by the package name for your app.
Then, enter the name of your app. Separate the package name and app name with a space.

If you format the description correctly, a GitHub Actions workflow will read it and update the project with your package
and app names. If it doesn't work, you can manually run another workflow once the repository is created.

Once initialization is done, the GitHub Actions workflows will be deleted, and you can set the repository description to
whatever you want.

Happy coding!
